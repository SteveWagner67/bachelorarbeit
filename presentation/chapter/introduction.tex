\frametitle{Requirements}

\underline{Old cryptographic interface}:
\begin{itemize}

	\item Cannot be use in other application without changing some functions
	\item No other library can be use without rewriting the interface
	\item To old regarding the evolution of the cryptograhy

\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\underline{New cryptographc interface GCI}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Possibility to use other cryptographic libraries
  \item Possibility to use it in hardware-coded-based cryptographic  
  modules
  \item Possibility to easily add new cryptographic algorithms

\end{itemize}
