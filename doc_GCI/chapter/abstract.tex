\section*{Abstract}

In this documentation you will find the description of all part of the Generic
Cryptographic Interface.

This interface has been done to replace an old one, a wrap cryptographic
interface, which was only created to be use for a specific project.

The aim of this interface is to be easily use for several projects, meaning that
all part of the cryptographic should be implemented.

Furthermore, some specifications was demanded for this interface which are:
\begin{itemize}
 	\item 	The use of contexts, which contain the most important information for
  			the use of a part of the cryptographic
	\item 	The use of identifiant (ID) for the context and keys, which increases
			the flexbility
\end{itemize}

The parts of cryptographic you will find are:
\begin{itemize}
  	\item	Hash 
  	\item	Signature (to sign and verify)
  	\item 	Generate key pairs (RSA, Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve)
  	\item	Cipher (symmetric and asymmetric to encrypt and decrypt)
  	\item 	Pseudo random number generator
\end{itemize}
