\chapter{Results}

In this chapter, the result of the implementation will be explained.
To test the implementation, several cipher suites have been used. These cipher
suites are shown in the figure \ref{fig:res}.
As we can see, almost all cipher suites work, only the cipher suites which use
ECDSA as key exchange don't work. This is because the ECDSA implementation has
been done in another project and the merge between the two project wasn't
done, because of the time.
