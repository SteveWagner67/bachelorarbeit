\chapter{Results}

To test the implementation of the interface in the application \embtls and the
implementation of the provider \tomcrypt in the interface, a testbench, which
was created in the Institute of Reliable Embedded Systems and Communications
Electronics (ivESK), has been used.
This testbench contains several cipher suites, to test different algorithms for
the three part described in a cipher suite, the key exchange, the bulk
encryption algorithm and the Message Authentication Code (MAC) (see section
\ref{intro_cipher}).

The tested key exchange algorithms are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item RSA for key exchange and certificates
  \item Diffie-Hellman (for the key exchange) and RSA (for the certificates)
  \item Elliptic Curve Diffie-Helman (for the key exchange) and RSA (for the
  certificates)
  \item Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (for the key exchange) and Elliptic Curve
  Digital Signature Algorithm (for the certificates)
\end{itemize}

the tested bulk encryption algorithms are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Stream cipher RC4
  \item Block cipher 3DES with CBC as a block mode
  \item Block cipher AES with CBC as a block mode
\end{itemize}

the tested Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms are:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) with SHA1
  \item Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) with SHA256
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:res} shows all the tested cipher suites. We can see that only
the cipher suites with ECDSA used in the certificates for the key exchange
don't work. This is because the elliptic curves was another project done at the
time as this project. ECDSA didn't still work when the project was taken to
implement this new interface.
