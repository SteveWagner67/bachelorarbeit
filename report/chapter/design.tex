\chapter{Design}

The requirements for this Generic Cryptographic Interface (GCI) are listed
below:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item No hidden states shall be used in the interface, meaning that the
  behavior of functions should only be affected by the input parameters.\newline
  All parameters written in input of the function will be used for the
  cryptographic algorithm and nothing else.
  \item Different cryptographic providers may be used for the cryptographic
  calculation. \newline
  That could be open-source cryptographic software libraries or hardware-based cryptographic modules.
  \item Interaction between the provider and the application shall be
  enable for the key by a  key management services, meaning that the key
  generated by the provider should be stored to have the possibility to use it
  by the application (like sending it to another peer) and keys coming from
  another peer shall be stored too, meaning that this key shall be used by the provder.
  \newline to interact between the application and
  the provider.
\end{enumerate}
